day 1 - Created the repo, with server and client. installed yarn, using that insted of npm for some reason.
	Client with React using react-boilderplate (should've used create-t3-app?), coding in Typescript, 
	styling with styled-components.
day 2 - Cleaned all up and starting coding the Nav structure, no logic yet. first commit.
	Added an ssh-key to my sistem and github, so now I can git commit -m "comment" and git push origin master.
	Developed a slider or carousel from scratch.
day 3 - Fixed the carousel, now it has another mechanism where it moves all the slider wrapper trought the X axis
	and it has cloned elements (first and last) that act as the start and end of the carousel. it's hard to explain.
day 4 - Implemented a slider for showing products
day 5 - Created a Login Form. Build the server (npm run devStart) with Typescript, using Prisma and Express. 
	Needed to create a prisma configuration file (read docs)
	Installed modules: prisma - typescript - ts/node - @types/node - nodemon - @prisma/client - jsonwebtoken
	Prisma commands: npx prisma init --datasource-provider postgresql / npx prisma migrate dev --name [name]
	/ npx prisma generate
	Authentication with jwt, still need to store token in localStorage and attach it to the header..
day 6 - Authentication works as it should. Created a Custom Hook so I can reuse de code for accessing the token.
	Working on the api. All the getters and setters
day 7 - Had to update react-router because the boilerplate usess an older version (v5.x) and v6 is more powerfull
	Also updated react from v16 to v18
	Implemented a global state using React Context to keep the logged User info around
